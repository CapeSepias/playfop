PlayFOP
=======

PlayFOP is a library for generating PDFs, images, and other types of output in [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) applications. PlayFOP accepts XSL-FO that an application has generated—via a Play [Twirl](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaTemplates) template, with the [scala-xml](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml) library, or as a `String`—and processes it with [Apache FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/).

For more information on PlayFOP, see its [homepage](https://www.dmanchester.com/playfop).

_On this branch, the PlayFOP sample applications rely on runtime dependency injection (DI). For compile-time DI versions, see the "sample-apps--compile-time-di" branch._
