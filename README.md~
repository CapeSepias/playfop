PlayFOP is a library for generating PDFs, images, and other types of output in [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) applications. PlayFOP accepts XSL-FO that an application has generated via a Play [Twirl](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaTemplates) template and processes it with [Apache FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/).
