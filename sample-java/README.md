PlayFOP Labels (Java)
=====================

PlayFOP Labels is a sample [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) application for PlayFOP and [Apache FOP](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/).
It demonstrates generating PDFs and images (PNGs) from Play [Twirl](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaTemplates) templates.
